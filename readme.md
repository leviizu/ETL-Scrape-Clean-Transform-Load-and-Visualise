# Sreality-Real-Estate-Scrape-Clean-Transform-Load-and-Visualise

## About the Project:

This project features an HTML scrape off of the Sreality website [https://www.sreality.cz/](https://www.sreality.cz/): The biggest real estate company/website (rents and sells) in Czech Republic (works as of 2023). Real Estate sales and rent data for solely apartments in the two major cities; Prague and Brno are scraped off this website. The scraping while looping through several pages extracts/scraps data which consists of apartment type, apartment size, street, district, town and price. Throughout the data cleaning and transformation process, I appropriately deal with nulls, dups in a should-be-unique column, and string data that should be split into multiple columns. I created dictionaries, functions, and visualizations that help me understand the distribution and values of data. I finish it off with some visualizations that show BMI and weight class! I do not know anything about football or BMI, but I am able to show a story with my code and visuals. Go Dawgs!!! Packages used:pandas, beautiful soup, numpy, matplotlib, requests, selenium)

## Tableau Dashboard:

The processed data is loaded into a csv file and imported into Tableau where viz are created to compare price to rent ratios across streets, types, districts etc
